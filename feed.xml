  <p>
    We are the Hunter Family, a Canadian transplant to Hawaii who moved to the island three years ago in search of a dream, Hawaii delivered that dream and we settled in a house cradled in Makaha Valley surrounded by lush mountains.
  </p>

  <p>
    The property features: a full working bar with sink, pool, tiny house with full bathroom/changing area, an outdoor bathroom, outdoor shower, tons of natural plants including fresh coconuts, oranges, variegated lemons (pink lemons), standard and finger limes, papaya, strawberry guava and standard mango.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can comfortably park approximately 8 cars at the front and up to 10 along the sides and back of the property. The side and back parking is recommended for small cars only as it is a narrow road and rocky.
  </p>

  <p>
    With over 1/1.5 acres of space there is tons of room to host the event of your dreams. A short walk to Makaha Beach, the property is in an ideal setting for events of any size.
