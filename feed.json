The side and back parking is recommended for small cars only as it is a narrow road and rocky.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    With over 1/1.5 acres of space there is tons of room to host the event of your dreams. A short walk to Makaha Beach, the property is in an ideal setting for events of any size.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n      \n    </div>\n  </div>",
